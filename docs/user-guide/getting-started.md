# Getting Started with Clara

## Quick Start

1.  **Open the App**: Navigate to the home page.
2.  **Enter Words**: In the "Word List" text area on the left sidebar, type or paste your words. Enter one word per line.
    *   *Tip*: Aim for 10-20 words for a standard puzzle.
3.  **Configure Settings**:
    *   **Grid Size**: Adjust the slider to change the grid dimensions (10x10 to 25x25).
    *   **Difficulty**: Select from Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expert. This controls the allowed directions (e.g., backwards, diagonal).
    *   **Shape**: Choose "Rectangle" for standard puzzles or "Circle" for a fun twist.
4.  **Generate**: Click the "Generate Puzzle" button.
5.  **Preview**: The puzzle will appear in the main preview area. Toggle "Show Solution" to see where the words are hidden.

## Tips for Best Results

*   **Word Length**: Avoid extremely long words that might not fit in the grid.
*   **Theme**: Group words by theme (e.g., "Animals", "Space", "Summer") for better engagement.
*   **Difficulty**: Use "Easy" for kids' books (horizontal/vertical only) and "Hard" for adult puzzle books.
